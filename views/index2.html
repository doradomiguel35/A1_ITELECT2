The need to understand and implement high-quality campaigns is essential if you're going to compete and thrive online, and that isn't going to change any time soon.<br><br><br> </p>

<p class="ubuntu"> 3. KEYWORD STRATEGY </p>
<img id="myImg" src="img/keyword.jpg" style="width: 800px;height: 300px;">
<p class="raleway"> This are essential to developing winning search engine marketing campaigns.

Choosing the right keywords for advertising can make all the difference in your campaigns, determining how well your advertisements rank on Google and other search engine platforms. <br><br><br></p>

<p class="ubuntu"> 4. TITLE TAGS STRATEGY </p>
<img id="myImg" src="img/title_tags.png" style="width: 800px;height: 300px;">
<p class="raleway"> Count your words carefully, the title tag is good in 70 characters, the search engine will show an ellipsis to indicate the the excess characters in the title tag has not been included anymore. One thing also is you have to put everything important first because, it's necessary to catch the attention of who's reading the title. <br><br><br></p>

<p class="ubuntu"> 5. META DESCRIPTION TAGS STRATEGY </p>
<img id="myImg" src="img/meta_desc.jpg" style="width: 800px;height: 300px;">
<p class="raleway"> To have the right meta description it should be around 135 to 160 characters, also it should be actionable, in an active voice. One thing also is it should include a call-to-action to make it more emphasizing, it's the sales text, where your product is the page that is linked. A meta description should match the content, it would be misleading for the user to see a meta description that's not matched by the content behind it. A meta description should also be unique, If the meta description is a duplicate, the user experience in Google will be less. Although page titles might vary, all pages seem the same as all descriptions are equal. <br><br><br></p>

<p class="ubuntu"> 6. ALT TAGS STRATEGY </p>
<img id="myImg" src="img/alt_tag.png" style="width: 800px;height: 300px;">
<p class="raleway">There are many elements to SEO and alt tags are just one piece of the puzzle. Image descriptions are important and represent another opportunity to include keywords on your site. Be thoughtful about the images you plan to include and think strategically about how an image may enhance an article, blog post or product page. <br><br><br></p>

<p class="ubuntu"> 7. SEARCH ENGINE INDEXING STRATEGY </p>
<img id="myImg" src="img/search_indexing.jpg" style="width: 800px;height: 300px;">
<p class="raleway"> To most search engines, keywords are vitally important. Because of this you will want to pay special attention to keywords and how they play a role in your website and ultimately search engine results. Be sure to know the rules and regulations of search engines in order to get a high ranking, increased traffic, and ultimate success. One major rule most search engines big and small adhere to is no spamming. Frames cause problems for a lot of search engines and as a result most search engines do not include web pages with frames in their indexes. To avoid this make sure you develop a website that has a unique URL for each page within your website. <br><br><br></p>

<font class="dosis">Is it possible to combine strategies? If yes, which strategies would you like to implement? Why? <br> </font>
<p class="raleway"> I would choose the domain name strategy and linking strategy because, if a linking strategy is implemented, there is a way for the website to be competitive in the SEO marketing, combined with domain name strategy, a unique and catchy name is necessary to catch the attention of the user </p>
